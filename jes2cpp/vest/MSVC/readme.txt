Visual C++ 2010 VeST32 Solution
===============================

This solution creates the VeST32.lib file, which is released with Jeez. If you want to
re-create this file, you will need to download the VST SDK.

You may use this solution to help you create VST effects with Visual C++, or to compare
Visual C++ output to GCC.

If you have problems with GCC, you may fix them using Visual C++. Its up to you.

I don't plan on using Visual C++ for VST development, so these solutions are only here
to help you with your work.
