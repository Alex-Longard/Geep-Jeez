Code::Block VeST32/64 Solution
==============================

This is the VeST source code + project files for 32bit and 64bit DLL's.

You will need to copy the VST SDK source code into the "VST3 SDK" folder without
changing its folder structure.

The project files are for the free "Code::Block" IDE.

You will also must have TDM-64. TDM-32 will not compile VSTGUI.

Cheers
Derek
